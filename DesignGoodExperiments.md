# <center> Design of good experiments </center>

Good experiments must answer a simple question, most of the time through a metric.

## Steps 

1. Design a simple question.
2. Define the metric that will be used.
3. Ensure experiment repeatability (Seed for datageneration, initialize weights, etc).
4. Make sure that it is not necessary to repeat the experiment in the future to obtain more conclusions (Save models to future load).
5. Try to answer just one question in a clear way (One plot per answer).
